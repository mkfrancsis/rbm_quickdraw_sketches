# rbm_quickdraw_sketches

This was a fun, quick project using the awesome dataset from the [Google Quick! Draw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) sketch game.  Google has provided all the data on the projects GitHub page -- I've used a small subset for this project.

I used an RBM neural net to create features in order to classify human drawn sketches.  This worked suprisingly well!
